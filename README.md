## About
Welcome to the AlphaSat project! This repository is dedicated to the design of the topology for constellations called AlphaSat. 
AlphaSat utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search and edge switching to efficiently search in a vast space and optimize the networking topology,
respectively, through two distinctive stages: initialization and refinement, progressively constructing an initial topology and 
exploring unknown possibilities for optimization.

## Features
- Low latency
- High robustness
- High load balancing
- Low power consumption
